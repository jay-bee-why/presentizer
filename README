Presentizer (http://jay-bee-why.com/presently/presently.html) is a single-page presentation template created using HTML, CSS3, and a little dash of jQuery. I originally built it for a client looking for a web-based alternative to a typical Powerpoint presentation. I was so pleased with how it turned out that I decided to resurrect it from a folder on my desktop and release it into the wild. I have a checklist going of more features I'd like to add, including documentation, but until then what you see is what you get. I also created this repository in an effort to learn a little about Git, so I'll be coming back to the code.

If you like what you see, help yourself. It requires jQuery and it's been browser tested for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. The "goal" functionality uses EasySlider (http://cssglobe.com/post/5780/easy-slider-17-numeric-navigation-jquery-slider). Drop me a tweet (<a href="http://twitter.com/thejaybeewhy">@theJayBeeWhy</a>) letting me know if you've put it to good use or improved it. I have no idea where this project is headed, but I'll eventually get around to adding a To-Do list for myself.

Good luck and happy presenting!
